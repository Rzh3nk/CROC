Hello world.
I love you.
Every time I revisit this final lap, I can remember my heartbeat spiking higher than it ever could on that special day, just unforgettable.
It is shit.
The last lap gives me chills even 2 years on... controversial yes, but one of the greatest moments in F1.
I hate him.
It has been exactly a year now and this will honestly be one of my favourite moments
Probably one of the greatest sporting events of all time one year ago today.
That was so stupid!
